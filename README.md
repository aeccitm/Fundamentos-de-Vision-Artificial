# Fundamentals of Artificial Vision

This repository contains several examples of computer vision applications that demonstrate different techniques and algorithms used in the field of computer vision. Below, we describe four specific examples that address different problems and employ distinct approaches to solve them.

# Application of Hu Moments for Classification using Linearly Polarized Images

In this example, we present a code that utilizes Hu moments as features for classifying linearly polarized images. Hu moments are a set of invariant moments used in pattern recognition and image analysis. In this case, they are applied to linearly polarized images to identify and classify different patterns.

# Hologram Reconstruction using Fourier Transform

In this second example, we provide a Matlab code that focuses on hologram reconstruction using the Fourier transform. Holograms are records of optical interference that contain three-dimensional information about an object. This code demonstrates how to apply the inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the original image from the hologram.

# Maize Disease Classification Model using SVM

The third example consists of a maize disease classification model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We provide a code that trains and evaluates an SVM model to classify images of maize diseases into different categories. SVM is a supervised machine learning technique that can be highly useful for early diagnosis of plant diseases.
